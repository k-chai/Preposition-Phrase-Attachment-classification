# Preposition Phrase Attachment Classification

The Preposition Phrase Attachment problem involves the challenge of determining whether a preposition in a sentence is attached to a verb or a noun. This distinction is crucial for understanding the intended meaning of a sentence.


In certain cases, the ambiguity in preposition attachment can lead to confusion for the reader. Consider the sentence:

```plaintext
San Jose cops kill man with a knife
```

This sentence can be interpreted in two ways:
1. The man was holding a knife.
2. The cops were holding a knife.

The difference in syntax parsing lies in the attachment of the preposition phrase either to the Verb Phrase ("kill with knife") or to the Noun Phrase ("man with knife").

In a project focused on predicting preposition phrase attachment, the primary goal is to develop a model that can automatically determine whether a preposition is attached to a verb or a noun in a given sentence.
